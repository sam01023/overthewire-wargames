Password: 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
Notes:
- In this level their were many types of file and we have to find the human redable file.

- The command is "sort data.txt | uniq -u "

LEVEL: Bandit9
Username: bandit9
Password: FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
Notes:
- In this level the password is in the file and is preceded by several '=' so I have used "strings" command to read the readable text from the file and then used grep to locate '='.
- The command is "strings data.txt | grep "===" ".

LEVEL: Bandit10
Username: bandit10
Password: dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
Notes:
- In this level the password is encoded in base64 format so I have used "base64" command.
- The command is "base64 -d data.txt "

LEVEL: Bandit11
Username: bandit11
Password: 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
Notes:
- In this level the password was encoded in caesar cipher, it is ROT13. Every letter in the file has been rotated 13 places in the aphlabet.
- The command I have used is "cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' "
- "tr" command is used to translate the characters.

LEVEL: Bandit12
Username: bandit12
Password: FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
Notes:
- In this level they have provided a hexdump of file  that has been repeatedly compressed.
- So first I have made a temp folder where I copied the file and then used "xxd -r data.txt > data.out " command to reverse hexdump back to binary file.
- The command used for this level was "file", "mv", "gunzip", "tar -xf", "bunzip2".
- This was a repetative process to unzipping the file using the above commands.
- first check the file type using "file" and then use others to unzip it.

LEVEL: Bandit13
Username: bandit13
Password: NA
Notes:
- In this level they haven't provided any password instead they have provided us a ssh key which we can use to access bandit14
- For this level I have used "ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220"

LEVEL: Bandit14
Username: bandit14
Password: 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
Notes:
- In this level I first got the password for bandit14 in "/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14".
- I have submitted that password to 30000 using "echo "bandit14-password" | nc localhost 30000 "
- "nc" is command used to read from and write to a network connections using TCP or UDP.

LEVEL: Bandit15
Username: bandit15
Password: kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
Notes:
- The objective for this level was to submit the password of bandit15 to port 30001 on localhost over a secure SSL/TLS connection.
- When the command "openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001" is run, first there will happen a SSL handshake which establishes a secure, encrypted communication channel with the service running on localhost at port 30001.
- After establishing this secure connection it expects to send the password for Bandit15 as input.
Then after giving the password the server responses with the password for next level.

LEVEL: Bandit16
Username: bandit16
Password: NA
Notes:
- In level 16 there was no password instead they have provided a RSA key to access the next level.
- Which was done by submitting the password of bandit16 to a port in the range 31000 - 32000.
- So I have used "nc -zv localhost 31000-32000 2>&1 | grep succeeded", where "z" tells nc to scan without actually sending data and "v" gives the detailed output.
- After getting all the ports I have used "echo "password-bandit16" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:<port> ". I have used this for every port and then I got key from one of the port.
- I saved that key in a temp folder and then used it to open the next level's ssh using "ssh -i bandit17_key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"

LEVEL: Bandit17
Username: bandit17
Password: x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
Notes:
- In this level we just have to find the line that is changed in the new password file.
- I have used "diff passwords.old passwords.new" to get the different texts, the second one is the password.

LEVEL: Bandit18
Username: bandit18
Password: cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8
Notes:
- In this level the password was stored in afile readme in homedirectory.
- But the .bashrd has been modified to log me out when log in with ssh.
- For this level I have used " ssh -T bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat ~/readme" " command to see only the readme file without using the .bashrc.
- "-T" tells the ssh to don't open a psedo-terminal and just do the job.
- when using the ssh it allocates a pseudo-terminal but in this level .bashrc which starts as the pseudo-terminal is allocated is not allowing us to log in so we used "-T" which doesn't allocate pseudo-terminal and instead does the job.

LEVEL: Bandit19
Username: bandit19
Password: 0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
Notes:
- This level provides us with setuid binary in the homedirectory.
- This is like a vehicale that takes us to the password for bandit20. It gives bandit19 the privilages of bandit20.
- To find out how to use this we have to first execute it with the command "./bandit20-do".
- After that use the command "./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20" and you will get the password.

LEVEL: Bandit20
Username: bandit20
Password: EeoULMCra2q0dSkYj561DX7s1CpBuOBt
Notes:
- In this level they have provided us with a setuid binary which makes connctions to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument.
- To get a free localhost port I first gave a command "echo "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO" | nc -zv localhost 1024-65535" and then I used "echo "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO" | nc -l -p 4444" to listen on the new port.
- On another teminal I have used "./bandit20-do 4444" this connects to the new port and then password new port reads it and then responses it with the password for bandit21.

LEVEL: Bandit21
Username: bandit21
Password: tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q
Notes:
- In this level we have to check what kind of job is running which we can look by read the "/etc/cron.d/*".
- It will give every job that is running at that time.
- We have to look for bandit22's job and then execute that file.
- The command that I used is "cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh" and then will give a shell script which by understanding, it tells that the password for bandit22 is stored in some sort of tmp file which it also gives it.
- And then I read that tmp file and I got the password.

LEVEL: Bandit22
Username: bandit22
Password: 0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga
Notes:
- Similar as bandit21, we have to look in the cron jobs.
- Look for the jobs related to bandit23.
- Then execute the file related to bandit23's job and then understand the script.
- The script told that the password is stored in the temp file, To get that temp file I have to use " echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f1 " and then read the tmp file and you will get the password.

LEVEL: Bandit23
Username: bandit23
Password: gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8
Notes:
- In this level we have to write a shell script for the first time.
- The cron executes a file in "/var/spool/bandit24/foo" as a bandit24 so we have to make a script that will store password of bandit24 while the cron is doing its job.
- So what we'll do in this is we will first make a tmp file and then write a shell script which should lopk like"
#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/pass/password
"
- And then copy this shell script to "/var/spool/bandit24/foo" after (1-2min) the cron will run it as a bandit24.
- The script says to store the password of bandit24 to the folder password which is in the bandit23.

LEVEL: Bandit24
Username: bandit24
Password: iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4
Notes:
- In this level we have to use brute force to get the password from the "localhost:30002".
- To connect with port 30002 we have to give password of bandit23 and four digit pin to it.
- The pin is anything from 0000-9999, so I have made a shell script "
#!/bin/bash

PASSWORD="gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8"

for PIN in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do
    echo "Trying PIN: $PIN"
    echo "$PASSWORD $PIN"
done | nc localhost 30002
"
- The script gives the pin from 0000 to 9999 and also connects to port 30002.
- Once the script runs it will scan with all the pins and will provide password for bandit25.

LEVEL: Bandit25
Username: bandit25
Password: s0773xxkk0MXfdqOfPRVr9L3jJBUOgCZ
Notes:
- In this level we have to login to bandit26 using command "ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" but you can see that it logs us out from it.
- So first we have to check why it is restricting us by reading the file in "/etc/passwd/bandit26".
- By understanding it, it tells that it restricts because of "showtext".
- So now while loging to bandit26 I have made my terminal screen small so it will get "more" option.
- While it is in "more" option type "v" it will open vim, now type ":set shell=/bin/bash" and then hit enter and then type ":shell" it will open bandit26's terminal now you can go to "/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26", you will get bandit26's password.

LEVEL: Bandit26
Useername: bandit26
Password: upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB
Notes:
- Now bandit26 contains of setuid file for bandit27.
- We first run that file "./bandit27-do"
- Then type the command "./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27"
