LEVEL:Leviathan0
Username: leviathan0
Password: 3QJ3TgzHDq
Notes:
- In this level I first looked for the files hidden using command "ls -la" and I found a folder named ".backup".
- I changed my directory to ".backup" and then I found a file named "bookmarks.html"
- I used "cat bookmarks.html | grep password" command to get the password from that file.

LEVEL: Leviathan1
Username: leviathan1
Password: NsN1HwFoyN
Notes:
- In this level they have provided with a setuid file to us, I first run the file and it asked me for a password.
- To get the password I have used "ltrace ./check" command. "ltrace" shows you all the library function calls a program makes while it runs.
- In this the password we type is compared with the correct password using the function "strcmp".
- You can see the correct password which is "sex".
- As you type "sex" you will go to the shell of leviathan2 where you can find you password in "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2".

LEVEL: Leviathan2
Username: leviathan2
Password: f0n8h2iWLP
Notes:
- In this level we have to use command injection technique.
- They have provided us with a setuid file named "printfile" what it does is that it just print the file using "/bin/cat".
- This file runs as leviathan3 but is in the leviathan2.
- So I have just made a file named "file;bash" in the tmp folder and used command injection technique.
- I have used "./printfile /tmp/file\;bash" to run it and get into the leviathan3 bash shell.
- From there you can get the password from "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3".

LEVEL: Leviathan3
Username: leviathan3
Password: WG1egElCvO
Notes:
- Similar to level 1, you have to use "ltrace" to find the correct answer.
- Once you type the correct answer it will take you to the leviathan4 shell.
- You will then be able to get the password from "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4".

LEVEL: Leviathan4
Username: leviathan4
Password: 0dyxT7F4QD
Notes:
- In this level there is a hidden folder called ".trash" inside that folder you will find a binary file which contains series of binary.
- Convert that series of binary to ascii text and that is you password for leviathan5.

LEVEL: Leviathan5
Username: leviathan5
Password: szo7HDB88w
Notes:
- In this level what we are doing is that we are using symlink to get the password.
- symlink is like a shortcut that is in the windows.
- They give us a file that reads a file name "file.log" in "tmp" folder.
- So I made a file named "file.log" in tmp folder and then I used symlink to link that to the leviathan6 password using command "ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log" 
then I have run the "leviathan5" file that they provided.
- It gives the password for leviathan6.

LEVEL: Leviathan6
Username: leviathan6
Password: qEs5Io5yM8
Notes:
- In this level they have provided with a file which needs a 4 digit code so that it will run the leviathan7 shell.
- for that we have write a one-line code "for i in {0000..9999};do echo $i; ./leviathan6 $i; done;".
- This will run till it gets correct code and then it starts leviathan7 terminal.
- then you can get the password for it from "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7".
